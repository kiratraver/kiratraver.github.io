<button onclick="firstFunction()">What did she cry?</button>

<p>Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.'If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:</p>

<button onclick="firstFunction()">What did he cry?</button>
 

<p>Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.</p>

<p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: 'He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does'; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.</p>
